I passed the Certificate of Merit Level 10 exam and also went to multiple piano competitions on top of yearly recitals. After quitting private lessons in high school due to work, I began to play more as a hobby, and started uploading footage of myself trying out challenging pieces on my Instagram and TikTok. I play mostly classical composers like Chopin, but also a large variety of other genres too!</p></div><div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-6"><div class="flex justify-center items-center"><div class="w-full max-w-3xl aspect-video"><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XOTlieuv-Sc" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="rounded-lg shadow-lg"></iframe></div></div></div><div class="mx-auto max-w-4xl mt-6 px-4"><p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-center leading-relaxed">I am a fan of Rubik&#x27;s Cube speedsolving and have participated in multiple official competitions since 2014.
