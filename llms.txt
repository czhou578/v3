## Career Overview & Biography
I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) with a Masters in Computer Science, preceded by a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Bellevue College. Originally born in Canada, I grew up in the Bay Area (Cupertino) and now reside in the Seattle, Washington area. 

I am a software developer with experience in full stack web development, artificial intelligence systems, backend architectures, and cloud services. My recent professional endeavors include working at Kaliber Labs as a Software Engineer orchestrating conversation pipelines and multiple LLMs, and previously at Nuclearn.ai (nuclear power startup) as a full stack engineer dealing with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, and embeddings. I've also completed several internships across civics, telecom, environmental, and educational sectors. My broad professional passion lies in integrating the latest capabilities of AI models strictly into end-user products—producing high quality, observable, and scalable results.

When I am away from a computer, my hobbies span competitive Rubik's Cube speedsolving (best competition time 12.92 seconds), performing and recording challenging classical piano pieces on my Instagram and TikTok accounts, doing 1000-piece jigsaw puzzles, or simply taking long walks around my neighborhood to reset.
