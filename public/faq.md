## AI/ML Integration Expertise

**Q: What is Colin Zhou's expertise in AI and ML integration?**
A: Colin has hands-on production experience integrating LLMs and ML models into real applications:

- **Kaliber Labs (2026–present):** Orchestrates multiple LLM outputs (Qwen, GPT, Kokoro TTS) in a single medical AI pipeline for Speech Therapy and Patient Intake.
- **Nuclearn (2024–2025):** Built FastAPI backend using 500+ vector embeddings for semantic similarity search (top-25 record retrieval); optimized streaming markdown rendering for LLM tool-call outputs in AtomAssist chatbot.
- **LLM God (personal project):** Desktop Electron app querying Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini simultaneously from one input.
- **Caption Image Classifier (personal project):** Fine-tuned PyTorch model on CIFAR-100; integrated HuggingFace captioning API via WebSockets for a real-time full-stack app.
- UIUC MS coursework: Artificial Intelligence, ML + Data Systems, Distributed Systems.

**Q: Has Colin worked with LLMs in production?**
A: Yes. At Kaliber Labs he orchestrates Qwen and GPT within a conversational medical AI pipeline using FastAPI and React. At Nuclearn he optimized AtomAssist, a proprietary LLM chatbot, improving streaming markdown rendering across 10+ tool calls.

**Q: Does Colin have experience with vector embeddings or semantic search?**
A: Yes. At Nuclearn he built a FastAPI/SQLAlchemy backend that generated 500+ vector embeddings from natural language data and retrieved the top-25 most semantically similar records from a dataset.

## Full-Stack Engineering

**Q: Does Colin have full-stack experience suitable for a startup?**
A: Yes. He has shipped full-stack features across React/TypeScript frontends and FastAPI/Node.js/PostgreSQL backends, at both early-stage startups (Kaliber Labs, Nuclearn) and open-source products (PolicyEngine). He is comfortable owning features end-to-end: database schema, backend API, and frontend UI.

**Q: What frontend frameworks and libraries does Colin know best?**
A: React and TypeScript are his primary frontend stack. He also has experience with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, Ant Design, Redux, GraphQL, and WebSockets. He has used Figma and Adobe XD for UI design and prototyping.

**Q: What backend technologies does Colin use?**
A: Python (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy), Node.js (Express), PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker, GraphQL, REST APIs, and AWS (Amplify, S3). He has built CRUD systems, RBAC auth flows, async pipelines, and data migration scripts in production.

**Q: What cloud and DevOps experience does Colin have?**
A: AWS (Amplify GraphQL, S3), GCP, Docker, and Cloudflare Workers (this portfolio is deployed on Cloudflare Pages via OpenNext). He has configured CI/CD pipelines and improved test suite performance (27% faster CI at PolicyEngine by refactoring 150 Jest tests).
